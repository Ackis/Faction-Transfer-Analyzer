==What it does
The Faction Transfer Analyzer assists with an automatic comparison of the changes that will occur should you choose to transfer your characters factions.

Blizzard has provided a detailed explaination [[http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/faction-change/index.xml | here]] however if you're worried about your reputations, or mounts, it may take you a long time to analyze what will occur when you transfer.  That's where this addon comes into play.  It will assist you by providing a summary of what will change based off your characters current status.

==Donations
I have setup a donation site via [[http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/3462|Pledgie]].  Feel free to donate if you like this mod.  I have put countless hours of time and effort into it along with many people who have helped me.  I did not write this mod with the intent to make any money from it.  I wrote it to help me with some needs that I saw in-game, and well with requests and my goal to make it filled with information it's become a massive project.

If you don't wish to donate money feel free to consider one of the following methods which may be more suitable:
* Volunteer time at your local animal shelter such as the [[http://www.edmontonhumanesociety.com/|Society for Prevention of Cruelty for Animals (SPCA)]] or drop a few bucks off for them.  If you do this, please let [[http://www.wowace.com/home/send-private-message/|me]] know.
* Send [[http://www.wowace.com/home/send-private-message/|me]] some UDE Points.  These points are obtained from the [[http://www.wowtcg.com/|World of Warcraft TCG and Mini]] game.
* Send some gold to one of the authors in-game or help out with some achievements, or even send a message saying thanks. :)
