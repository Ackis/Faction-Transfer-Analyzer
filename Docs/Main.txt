==What it does
The Faction Transfer Analyzer assists with an automatic comparison of the changes that will occur should you choose to transfer your characters factions.

Blizzard has provided a detailed explanation [[http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/faction-change/index.xml | here]] however if you're worried about your reputations, or mounts, it may take you a long time to analyze what will occur when you transfer.  That's where this addon comes into play.  It will assist you by providing a summary of what will change based off your characters current status.

===Testing Information
Right now this mod is in testing.  As of 0.4Beta, all the mount and reputation transfers are in place.  Please report a bug if you find an issue.

*** Ackis is currently looking for a guild (along with his girlfriend).  We're looking for a guild which has competent people that can progress through the hard modes, aren't full of themselves and raids somewhat casually (2-3 nights a week).

==How to get it to work
This mod works via slash commands only.  The main slash command is **/fta**.

<<code>>/fta (Transfer Race) (Origin Race)<</code>>

The slash command takes two parameters, the first being the race you wish to transfer to, the second being the race you are transferring from.  The second command is optional.

===Examples

<<code>>/fta orc<</code>> - Transfer from current race to orc
<<code>>/fta orc human<</code>> - Transfer from a human to orc
<<code>>/fta ne be<</code>> - Transfer from a blood elf to night elf
